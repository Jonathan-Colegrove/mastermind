# MasterMind
This was our week 3 assignment 4.
Our job was to program the MasterMind board game.

There are 6 colors in the game:
<pre>
* Blue       * Purple
* Orange     * Yellow
* Green      * Pink
</pre>

The computer chooses 4 (there can be duplicates).
Players have 10 guesses to solve.

We used `sinatra`, advanced our `HTML` & `CSS` skills, as well as used `erb` to make the game load variables dynamically.

I learned a lot about using `Ruby` code inside the browser; it was very exciting to see what it could do!

# To Play:
type `ruby web.rb` into the terminal & navigate to [localhost:4567](localhost:4567).
